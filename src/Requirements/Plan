#What we are doing:
Basically a client to make you p&p life easy (DSA only for now)

Basic Functions:
1. Enter all your stats that are important for rolling dice, health and resource(astral/karma) (dynamic)
2. Enter modifiers to you roll
3. Enter what stats you are rolling on (Presets would be preferable)
4. Roll it! Calculated using everything above, returns quality level
5. Basic GUI
6. Terminal version for testing

Extra:
1. Profile system, save/load feature using all stats, if you use karma or astral etc.
2. Good looking GUI
3. Map feature (changeable grid, figure placement, underlay a picture)
4. TBD...

CLASSES (explain what they do):

DiceProp: creates dice with specified sides and amount to dice pool, has roll function
Functionality: Handles everything, which has to do with stats, health and resources - REMOVED
Roll: Class to make it easier to output a roll and which die was used
StatNames: ENUM to make stats more clear
Savestate: the new "Functionality", but with better integration
FunctionalStuff.Manager: Creates objects of all classes to handle communication between them
Savedata: The data of Savestate that is needed to save
ErrorController: Handling FXML Error

GUI: does what is says
Terminal: for testing without having to use gui

THE SAVE DIRECTORY IS WHERE SAVES WILL BE LOCATED! (if it wasn't obvious)

!!! ADD CLASSES TO LIST, IF YOU CREATE THEM - WITH EXPLANATION !!!
