#What we are doing:
Basically a client to make you p&p life easy (DSA only for now)

Basic Functions:
1. Enter all your stats that are important for rolling dice, health and resource(astral/karma) (dynamic)
2. Enter modifiers to you roll
3. Enter what stats you are rolling on (Presets would be preferable)
4. Roll it! Calculated using everything above, returns quality level
5. Basic GUI
6. Terminal version for testing

Extra:
1. Profile system, save/load feature using all stats, if you use karma or astral etc.
2. Good looking GUI
3. Map feature (changeable grid, figure placement)
4. TBD...
